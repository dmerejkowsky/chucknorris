# ChuckNorris

*Note: I've spend quite a long time in my programming career thinking about C++ compilation, and it's a topic I no longer have interest in. As such, the code here, like the accompanying blog posts, are now read-only and probably will get out-of-date one day. Sorry about that, but I thought you ought to know.*

This repository contains a library written in `c++` that depends on `sqlite3`

It also contains:

* wrappers for the following languages:
  * `C`
  * `Java`  (with `jna`)
  * `Python3` (with `cffi`)
  * `Objective-C`

* an Android application
* an iOS application

* and all the scripts you need to build everything without pull your hair out :)

It's used as an example for the [Let's Build Chuck Norris](https://dmerej.info/blog/post/introducing-the-chuck-norris-project/) series on my blog.
